I have been interested in technology since I was a kid. From elementary school where I would tear apart controllers and such to see how they worked to building my first computer in high school. I have always enjoyed learning these new tools to interact with everything around me.
Outside of tech, you can sometimes find me hiking to get out of the city or playing video games.
